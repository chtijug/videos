AI-Augmented Programing in Java: Agentic Systems ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ â€” Stephan Janssen

Nowadays, it's hard to not be close to someone talking about AI,
OK, but how does this work and how, as Java developers, can we benefit from this new tool ?
That what Stephan will explain and demo with the DevoxxGenie plugin for JetBrains'platorm based IDE.

Thanks a lot @Stephan007 for being with us and sharing your near future forecast !

We're also glad for IUT Lille to host the meetup.

And many Thanks to our season sponsors supporting our actions: AXA, Norsys and Zenika
